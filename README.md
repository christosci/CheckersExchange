# CheckersExchange
A brain game based on checkers

The goal in this game is to get all pieces to the opposite side of the board, such that blue pieces are at the top and green pieces are at the bottom. Pieces can only move forward within the white squares.

This is a very simple game for now. There are no fancy endings or scoreboards.
